        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                I am a 3rd year Software Technology student from De La Salle University who enjoys solving
                problems through code. I am fueled by curiosity and a desire to learn new technologies that
                will further help me discover new ways to create new solutions. I thrive on challenges, never
                running out of things to further my knowledge, and encourages me to create.
                <br><br>
                Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and drawing.
                <br><br>
                Given my PCK and APQ results, I've realized that I am conventional - someone who likes to work
                following set procedures and routines. I prefer working when there are precise standards rather than
                judging things by myself, which admittedly I am very indecisive about. Moreover, I have also learned
                that I am also investigative - someone who likes to work activities that are related to ideas and
                thinking, more than physical activity. Some work importance values that were considered my top include
                support, achievement, and relationships. For one, support means that I prefer having a support role in
                work such as being a credit analyst, aviation inspector, etc. On the other hand, achievement means that
                I value jobs that value achievement like sketch artists, surveyors, and computer programmers. On the
                other hand, relationships mean that I value jobs that value relationships. Subsequent ot this, I have
                also learned that I am mostly proficient in my cognitive abilities, i.e. arithmetic reasoning, verbal
                ability, spatial ability, computation, clerical perception, and form perception.

        <h2>LRF Reflection</h2>
        <div class="reflection-content">
            <p>
                Experiencing the SAS3000 course has allowed me to, in a way, adjust to adulting more smoothly - it was eye-opening.
                It gave me the opportunity to reflect on my career journey and aspirations. I realized strengths I hadn't acknowledged or highlighted about myself.
                One of those being my ability to adapt and accomplish my tasks under pressure. At the same time, I've become aware of weaknesses that I can put more effort into to grow - like being more consistent in following through with my plans. This course has also helped to see how my values help me with developing a clear sense of direction in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such I've noticed that my past experiences, both setbacks and victories, play a big role in how I am now as a person and how I approach my career.
                For instance, my experiences of being more diligent in accomplishing my tasks ahead of time has told me that it pays off.
                Moreover, having perseverance in working to achieve a task or goal is a quality that I need to grasp and develop. At the same time, I've realized that striving for perfection isn't necessarily always the best - it might even be something that will hold me back.
                Wherefore, recognizing these has helped me make more mindful decisions in my future endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the aforementioned, I have discovered several things that I want to improve about myself. For one, I'd like to be more disciplined with how I manage my time and expend my energy, especially when it comes to balancing responsibilities.
                I also want to become better at managing myself in group settings and uncertainty, so I can stay focused on my goals and properly collaborate with my peers to achieve a common goal.
                Building and developing my communication skills is another area I want to work on because I have learned that it's essential for both personal and professional growth.
                By working on these qualities, I believe I can approach challenges with more confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                In tangent with this, I've come to understand that every action I take will have an effect not just on me and my career, but those around me as well.
                For instance, when I am around someone who I view as competent and responsible, I take inspiration from them and draw out motivation to improve myself as an individual and in my career.
                Moreover, I've experienced a lot to make me lean to embodying the principle of 'if not now, when?' - it's either I have to take action or stay stuck in self-doubt, and I would rather take action.
                This realization motivates me to act with purpose and meaning, in the partial hope to also inspire others.
